# EcoSwape & CBDC Payment Platform

## Overview
**EcoSwape** is a decentralized exchange (DEX) designed to facilitate carbon credit trading while enforcing carbon offset with every transaction. Combined with a **CBDC Payment Platform**, it supports global, multi-currency payment solutions, offering a seamless user experience for both individuals and merchants. The platform uses blockchain technology for transparency, AI for personalized recommendations and fraud detection, Grafana for real-time insights, and CDN architecture for global scalability.

- **MPC Wallets**: Enhanced security for user funds through multi-party computation.

## Core Components

1. **Blockchain Infrastructure**: 
   - Polygon (Layer 2) for scalability and cost-efficient decentralized transactions.
   - Ripple CBDC platform integration for facilitating cross-asset payments and fiat integration.

2. **Verification System**:
   - Third-party registries like Verra and Gold Standard for carbon credit legitimacy.
   - Machine learning models for fraud detection in carbon credit trading.
  
3. **Carbon Offset**:
   - Carbon offset tracking via smart contracts integrated with real-world projects.
   - Funding for offset projects via transaction fees or a dedicated offset pool.

4. **Payment Methods**:
   - Support for NFC tap-to-pay, barcode scanning, and traditional card payments.
   - Supports fiat (CBDCs), stablecoins, and cryptocurrencies within the same wallet.

5. **Banking & Financial Services**:
   - Automated credit assessment based on KYC and spending habits.
   - Integration with microfinance, savings accounts, investments, and loans.

6. **User Features**:
   - AI-powered recommendations, including merchant and payment method suggestions.
   - Automated savings and investment management with ROI features.

7. **Real-Time Insights**:
   - Use Grafana dashboards for visualizing platform performance, API response times, and usage data.

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Polygon (Layer 2), Ripple CBDC
- **Smart Contracts**: Ethereum (ERC-1155)
- **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Databases**: MongoDB (for user data, financial records)
- **AI/ML**: Python-based models for predictive insights and fraud detection

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn for package management
- Docker (for local environment setup)

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-repository>/EcoSwape-CBDC-Payment
   cd EcoSwape-CBDC-Payment
```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Setup MongoDB (or use hosted MongoDB Atlas instance) for backend.
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Set up blockchain (Polygon & Ripple SDK) for local testing or connect to the main network for production deployment.

### Testing

1. Run unit tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```
2. Use Postman or Swagger to interact with the APIs and verify the flow.
